	abstract = {Quantum computing technology may soon deliver revolutionary improvements in algorithmic performance, but it is useful only if computed answers are correct. While hardware-level decoherence errors have garnered significant attention, a less recognized obstacle to correctness is that of human programming errors—“bugs.” Techniques familiar to most programmers from the classical domain for avoiding, discovering, and diagnosing bugs do not easily transfer, at scale, to the quantum domain because of its unique characteristics. To address this problem, we have been working to adapt formal methods to quantum programming. With such methods, a programmer writes a mathematical specification alongside the program and semiautomatically proves the program correct with respect to it. The proof’s validity is automatically confirmed—certified—by a “proof assistant.” Formal methods have successfully yielded high-assurance classical software artifacts, and the underlying technology has produced certified proofs of major mathematical theorems. As a demonstration of the feasibility of applying formal methods to quantum programming, we present a formally certified end-to-end implementation of Shor’s prime factorization algorithm, developed as part of a framework for applying the certified approach to general applications. By leveraging our framework, one can significantly reduce the effects of human errors and obtain a high-assurance implementation of large-scale quantum applications in a principled way.}

Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple, low-level language called sqir, a small quantum intermediate representation, which is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of sqir programs. sqir programs denote complex-valued matrices, as is standard in quantum computation, but we treat matrices symbolically to reason about programs that use an arbitrary number of quantum bits. sqir’s careful design and our provided automation make it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in voqc, including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.},

Their fundamental unit of communication is the Bell pair, which consists of two entangled quantum bits. Unfortunately, Bell pairs are fragile and difficult to transmit directly, necessitating a network of repeaters, along with software and hardware that can ensure the desired results. To this end, we developed BellKAT, a novel specification language for quantum networks based upon Kleene algebra. To cater to the specific needs of quantum networks, we designed an algebraic structure, called BellSKA, which we use as the basis of BellKAT’s denotational semantics. BellKAT’s constructs describe entanglement distribution rules that allow for modular specification. We give BellKAT a sound and complete equational theory, allowing us to verify network protocols. We provide a prototype tool to showcase the expressiveness of BellKAT and how to verify networks in practice.},

	abstract = {Quantum networks have capabilities that are impossible to achieve using only classical information. They connect quantum capable nodes, with their fundamental unit of communication being the Bell pair, a pair of entangled quantum bits. Due to the nature of quantum phenomena, Bell pairs are fragile and difficult to transmit over long distances, thus requiring a network of repeaters along with dedicated hardware and software to ensure the desired results. The intrinsic challenges associated with quantum networks, such as competition over shared resources and high probabilities of failure, require quantitative reasoning about quantum network protocols. This paper develops PBKAT, an expressive language for specification, verification and optimization of quantum network protocols for Bell pair distribution. Our language is equipped with primitives for expressing probabilistic and possibilistic behaviors, and with semantics modeling protocol executions. We establish the properties of PBKAT’s semantics, which we use for quantitative analysis of protocol behavior. We further implement a tool to automate PBKAT’s usage, which we evaluated on real-world protocols drawn from the literature. Our results indicate that PBKAT is well suited for both expressing real-world quantum network protocols and reasoning about their quantitative properties.},

abstract = {Most existing quantum programming languages are based on the quantum circuit model of computation, as higher-level abstractions are particularly challenging to implement—especially ones relating to quantum control flow. The Qunity language, proposed by Voichick et al., offered such an abstraction in the form of a quantum control construct, with great care taken to ensure that the resulting language is still realizable. However, Qunity lacked a working implementation, and the originally proposed compilation procedure was very inefficient, with even simple quantum algorithms compiling to unreasonably large circuits.    In this work, we focus on the efficient compilation of high-level quantum control flow constructs, using Qunity as our starting point. We introduce a wider range of abstractions on top of Qunity's core language that offer compelling trade-offs compared to its existing control construct. We create a complete implementation of a Qunity compiler, which converts high-level Qunity code into the quantum assembly language OpenQASM 3. We develop optimization techniques for multiple stages of the Qunity compilation procedure, including both low-level circuit optimizations as well as methods that consider the high-level structure of a Qunity program, greatly reducing the number of qubits and gates used by the compiler.},
