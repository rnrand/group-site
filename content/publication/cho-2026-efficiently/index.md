abstract: 'We mechanize a lightweight quantum logic in the Rocq proof assistant to
  verify Clifford+T quantum programs, particularly those with low T counts. Our tool
  is lightweight and automation-centric: Hoare triple validation composes simple rules,
  reduces all obligations to syntactic well-formedness side-conditions, and efficiently
  discharges those conditions. We demonstrate our tool using several case studies:
  a standard low-T Toffoli decomposition, graph-state generators, and the 7-qubit
  Steane encoder. A small empirical study on graph-state families shows near-linear
  growth in the number of Clifford gates and a slightly super-quadratic trend in the
  number of qubits, consistent with implementation overheads from list-based tensor
  representations, while repeated T gates on a single qubit exhibit an exponential
  blow-up due to additive branching. The results indicate that a rule-driven, syntax-directed
  approach suffices to verify low-T quantum circuits while keeping the trusted core
  and user-facing proofs simple.'
