abstract: The main attributes of quantum networks are the utilization of quantum phenomena,
  security guarantees, and availability of their main quantum resource - entanglement.
  The fundamental differences between classical and quantum information will require
  joint efforts in physics, engineering and computer science to make quantum networks
  functional and scalable. A common language must be established between the hardware
  and software community. We envision a foundational model for quantum network programming
  languages. Such a model should contain the essential constructs for programming
  quantum networks, allow for specification and verification of end-to-end entanglement
  distribution, and provide guidelines for composing network protocols.
