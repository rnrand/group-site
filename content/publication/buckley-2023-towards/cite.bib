 abstract = {The main attributes of quantum networks are the utilization of quantum phenomena, security guarantees, and availability of their main quantum resource - entanglement. The fundamental differences between classical and quantum information will require joint efforts in physics, engineering and computer science to make quantum networks functional and scalable. A common language must be established between the hardware and software community. We envision a foundational model for quantum network programming languages. Such a model should contain the essential constructs for programming quantum networks, allow for specification and verification of end-to-end entanglement distribution, and provide guidelines for composing network protocols.},
