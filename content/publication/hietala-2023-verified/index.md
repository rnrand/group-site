abstract: We present voqc, the first verified optimizer for quantum circuits, written
  using the Coq proof assistant. Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple,
  low-level language called sqir, a small quantum intermediate representation, which
  is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed
  as Coq functions, which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of sqir programs.
  sqir programs denote complex-valued matrices, as is standard in quantum computation,
  but we treat matrices symbolically to reason about programs that use an arbitrary
  number of quantum bits. sqirâ€™s careful design and our provided automation make it
  possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in voqc, including full-circuit
  transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.
