 abstract = {We present voqc, the first verified optimizer for quantum circuits, written using the Coq proof assistant. Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple, low-level language called sqir, a small quantum intermediate representation, which is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of sqir programs. sqir programs denote complex-valued matrices, as is standard in quantum computation, but we treat matrices symbolically to reason about programs that use an arbitrary number of quantum bits. sqirâ€™s careful design and our provided automation make it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in voqc, including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.},
